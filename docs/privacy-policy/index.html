      <h2>Information we collect</h2>

      <h3>Information you provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <p><strong>Contact info:</strong> If you email us, we receive your email address and whatever you include in the message.</p>
        <p><strong>Any details you share voluntarily:</strong> For example, project inquiries or feedback.</p>
      </ul>

      <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
      <p>
        Like most websites, we may automatically receive certain information when you visit the Site, such as your device type,
        browser type, approximate location (derived from IP), pages viewed, and the general time and date of your visit.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cookies, analytics, and advertising</h2>

      <h3>Meta Pixel</h3>
      <p>
        We use the <strong>Meta Pixel</strong> to understand how people use our Site and to measure the effectiveness of advertising.
        The Pixel can collect or receive information about your visit (for example: pages you view and cookie/device identifiers)
        and may use that information to provide measurement services and deliver more relevant ads on Meta platforms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meta's terms require that we provide a clear notice on pages where the Pixel is used and link to an explanation like this one.
        For more about how Meta handles information, review Meta's privacy materials. (We do not control Meta's practices.) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
      </p>

      <h3>Your choices</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Browser controls:</strong> You can use browser settings to delete or block cookies. Note that blocking cookies can affect site functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ad preferences:</strong> You can adjust ad settings within Meta/Facebook/Instagram accounts to limit interest-based ads.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Opt-out tools:</strong> Some jurisdictions require opt-in consent for non-essential tracking. If you are in the EU/UK, tracking technologies like ad pixels generally require prior consent. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
