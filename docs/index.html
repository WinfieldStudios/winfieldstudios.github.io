      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>We started small—just a kid named Kyle coding games alone at 14. Over a decade later, I’m still here, still building, still obsessed with the feeling of a great idea coming to life.</p>
      <p>Winfield Studios was founded to bring that feeling to others. This studio is about growth—in the strange, organic, mycelial kind of way. We value game feel, immersion, and meaning in even the smallest interactions. Every sound, every tap, every visual choice matters. That’s the magic.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re here to play or just curious, thanks for being a part of the beginning.</p>
